# Fall2020
Projects and Assignments From Fall 2020

This repository has all the files I created for classes. These classes were
me learning JavaScript, Preparing for certification exams with HTML and CSS 
as well as certification exam for Java Development.

I did not write a lot of this code as it came from assignments with a starting 
point that I had to either add on to or sometimes create a whole new file.
